# GTA Style Cursor

![Screenshot of app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaxBranvall/GTACursor/main/Screenshot%202020-12-02%20094810.png)

- The basic app that lets you change your mouse cursor to the infamous middle finger cursor that we all know and love!

## Installation
- Easy!
    - Navigate to the release section over on the right hand side
    - Download and unzip the included zip file wherever your heart desires
    - Double click GTAStyleCursor.exe.
      - If prompted to download the .NET 5 runtime (~50MB), go ahead and do so.
      - Incase you were not prompted and can not run the app, [here's a link](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/current/runtime) to the download page.
      - You will most likely be just fine downloading the x64 runtime.
    - Enjoy!
    
## Cursor Modification
- If you want to change your cursor with any other cursor file, just place it in the cursors/ folder in the application folder and name it, not including the quotes, "_middleFinger.cur".
- I did write a custom library to handle changing the cursor and will be open sourcing it soon. It is not at all specific to this application and has much more flexibility, including changing any specific cursor.
