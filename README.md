## Installation
- Easy!
    - Navigate to the release section over on the right hand side
    - Download and unzip the included zip file wherever your heart desires
    - Double click GTAStyleCursor.exe.
      - If prompted to download the .NET 8 runtime (~50MB), go ahead and do so.
      - Incase you were not prompted and can not run the app, [here's a link]([https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/current/runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0/runtime)) to the download page.
      - You will most likely be just fine downloading the x64 desktop app runtime.
    - Enjoy!
    
## About This Project
- Uses my [library](https://github.com/MaxBranvall/WinCursorChanger) for changing Windows cursors.
- Written with WPF using .NET 8.
    
## Troubleshooting
- **If a window pops up stating "Windows protected your PC" click "More info" and then click "Run Anyway". I promise, this app is not doing anything malicious. You are more than welcome to take a look at the source code :)**
- If you attempted to change a cursor or revert back to default and you do not see any changes despite a "Success" message, simply log-out and log back in.
    
## Cursor Modification
- If you want to change your cursor with any other cursor file, just place it in the cursors/ folder in the application folder and name it, not including the quotes, "_middleFinger.cur".
